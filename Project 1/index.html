	<p>Basketball is a sport played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. 
	The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter 
	and 10 feet (3.0 m) high mounted to a backboard at each end. Basketball is one of 
	the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.A team can score a field goal by 
	shooting the ball through the basket during regular play. A field goal scores two
	points for the shooting team if a player is touching or closer to the basket than 
	the three-point line, and three points (known commonly as a 3 pointer or three) if 
	the player is behind the three-point line. The team with the most points at the end
    of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) may be issued when the game ends
	with a draw. The ball can be advanced on the court by bouncing it while walking 
	or running or throwing it to a team mate. It is a violation to move without 
	dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume 
	dribbling.   </p>
